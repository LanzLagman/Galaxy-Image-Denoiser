# Galaxy Image Denoiser
 A simple convolutional autoencoder is constructed for denoising images from the Galaxy10 dataset. The encoder is composed of a pair of convolutional and max pooling layer while the decoder is composed of a pair of convolutional and upsampling layer. In the future, I plan to build a custom function that builds an autoencoder based on the dimensions of the input image data, with the ability to add more paired layers for the encoder and decoder components.
